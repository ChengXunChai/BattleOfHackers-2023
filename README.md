# ASEAN Battle Of Hackers (ABOH) 2023 Writeups

Welcome to my ASEAN Battle Of Hackers (ABOH) 2023 writeups! ðŸŽ‰

## My Approach

As a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast, I approach the ASEAN Battle Of Hackers (ABOH) 2023 with the following goals:

- **Learn:** Every challenge is an opportunity to learn something new, whether it's a new technique, tool, or concept.
- **Collaborate:** I enjoy collaborating with fellow participants to share insights and knowledge, making the journey more enriching.
- **Document:** I'll be writing detailed writeups for the challenges I solve, helping others and reinforcing my own understanding.

## Writeups

Please note that this repository does not include all the challenges from the competition, but a sub-set of those that I have downloaded or solved. Some challenges, such as web challenges that provided external weblinks, are not included as they are no longer be accessible. Please also take note that while this repository does not contain the official writeups by FSEC-SS, it features a participant's writeup. 

## My Team 

My team, CTRL+SHIFT+HACKERS, consist of Jaythan Chew Kam Wye, Nicholas Chong Wei Chen and me.
